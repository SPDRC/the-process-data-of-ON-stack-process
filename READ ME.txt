
In the ON stack process, the chamber was conditioned through the pre-run process. The pre-run recipe had the same conditions as the ON stack process. The total experimental flow is as follows:

Pre-run 1st (deposition)
Chamber cleaning process
ON stack process_cycle 1
ON stack process_cycle 2
ON stack process_cycle 3
ON stack process_cycle 4
ON stack process_cycle 5
ON stack process_cycle 6
Chamber cleaning process


The chamber cleaning process data only includes RGA data due to the remote plasma chamber cleaning.
If you wish to study the chamber cleaning process, please refer to the 'pre_run CLN.csv' file. This data contains information for chamber cleaning in the five paired ON stack processes.
